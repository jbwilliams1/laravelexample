## Laravel Example Project

This application may work outright but was never intended for actual use. It is a gutted version of a production site I had created for one of my clients, with all views and references to the company removed in a hasty manner. For that reason, many of the views are empty and the pages contain no useful information.

## Features of this application

- User registration / authentication
- Calendar Event creation / editing / removing
- Page creation / editing / removing (using CKEditor) // CMS style with custom page templates, full HTML support
- Blog (Same as Pages, different routes and controller)
- Orderly Database Migrations
- A loose interpretation of Object Oriented MVC architecture (Laravel's specialty!)
- Node Dependency Management
- Laravel Elixer (Gulp) for compiling LESS assets into a singular CSS file
- Some AJAX functionality completed (namely contact form)
- jQuery, Bootstrap, Fontawesome
- Facebook & Instagram API implementation. Facebook using a library, Instagram using adhoc GuzzleHTTP requests


## Why?

It serves as a somewhat robust code sample, demonstrating how an application by me looks when being made for a lower budget client. 

## How long did it take?

I built this web application in it's production form (with fully completed view markup, testing, etc) in about 12 working hours. It was a rather hasty project but I believe it adheres close enough to
my typical stylistic approach to PHP to be used as a demonstration.
